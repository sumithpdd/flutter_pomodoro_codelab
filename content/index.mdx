# Overview

Flutter is Google’s portable UI kit for crafting high-quality native interfaces on **iOS** and **Android** in record time. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free and open source.

**Workshop**

* Together we'll work through Flutter + Firebase as codelab. You will be able to get hands-on experience with Flutter and build a real-time **Pomodoro app** ⏰ with flutter and firebase products, while learning the fundamentals. This is an intermediary level talk.
* Users will use firebase sign in, interact with the cloud Firestore database, update images to firebase storage, push notifications and analytics.

  Let's start with the Pomodoro application where we can see and send messages and images.

The exercises contains these steps

* Introduction
* Project Structure
* Home Screen
* Settings Screen
* Connectivity with Realm
