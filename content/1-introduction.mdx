# Proposed Work

A high-level overview of what we're building.

An Pomodoro app 🧑‍💻

The Pomodoro Technique is a **time management system** that encourages people to work with the time they have—rather than against it. Using this method, you break your workday into 25-minute chunks separated by five-minute breaks.
